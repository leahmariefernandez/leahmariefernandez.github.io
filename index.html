        <p>There is a growing body of literature examining exposure inequalities in Canada; however, a significant gap remains in 
            addressing the cumulative impact of multiple air pollutants on communities (Giang, 2020). Current studies examining the 
            link between long-term air pollution exposure and negative health outcomes often recognize that the reported associations
            are likely driven by a combination of pollutants rather than the isolated impact of a single pollutant (Pope et al., 
            2004; Lee et al., 2009; Hoek et al., 2013 as cited in Pearce et al., 2016). The research I am conductingThis research 
            focuses on visualizing and analyzing complex pollution data. This research is conducted in collaboration with 
            Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), with the aim of directly supporting their risk assessment processes. 
            It aims to develop techniques that simplify the interpretation of multi-pollutant data by reducing its complexity and 
            improving accessibility for those who rely on its findings.
