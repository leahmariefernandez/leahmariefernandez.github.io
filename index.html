        <p class="p">There is a growing body of literature examining exposure inequalities in Canada; however, a significant gap remains in 
            addressing the cumulative impact of multiple air pollutants on communities (Giang, 2020). Current studies examining the 
            link between long-term air pollution exposure and negative health outcomes often recognize that the reported associations
            are likely driven by a combination of pollutants rather than the isolated impact of a single pollutant (Pope et al., 
            2004; Lee et al., 2009; Hoek et al., 2013 as cited in Pearce et al., 2016). The research I am conductingThis research 
            focuses on visualizing and analyzing complex pollution data. This research is conducted in collaboration with 
            Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), with the aim of directly supporting their risk assessment processes. 
            It aims to develop techniques that simplify the interpretation of multi-pollutant data by reducing its complexity and 
            improving accessibility for those who rely on its findings.

            Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), are widely used to simplify 
            complex datasets by reducing the number of variables while retaining as much information as possible. PCA has been 
            used to transform air pollution data, which involves multiple correlated pollutants, into a set of uncorrelated 
            principal components. By using PCA, it is aimed to capture the maximum variance in the data with a smaller number 
            of components, simplifying the analysis of complex air quality patterns. Techniques which follow PCA are unsupervised 
            clustering, such as Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). SOMs have been effectively applied in air quality research for various 
            objectives. For instance, SOMs have been used to classify ambient air quality by grouping days with similar 
            multi-pollutant profiles in a time series analysis (Pearce et al., 2014). In a later study, SOMs were used to find 
            long-term spatial patterns of multi-pollutant combinations and were analyzed to understand their alignment with at-risk 
            populations (Pearce et al., 2016). Despite these advances, there is no single structure that effectively integrates 
            multi-pollutant data across varying time and spatial scales that accounts for pollutant chemical complexity.
